# Snag Solutions Template App

This repository contains a Next.js boilerplate with Tailwind CSS, designed to showcase a demo Web3 application. The demo illustrates how clients can utilize Snag SDK to quickly build a website featuring:

- Web3 authentication
- A loyalty program with a leaderboard
- A profile page displaying user account details and loyalty points history

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- PNPM (latest version)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Environment Variables

To use the application, you must configure the required environment variables in a `.env` file:

```env
SNAG_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_ID=your_website_uuid
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_ID=your_organization_uuid
LOYALTY_CURRENCY_ID=your_loyalty_currency_id
ENABLE_TWITTER_RULES=boolean # Optional
ENABLE_TELEGRAM_RULES=boolean # Optional
RULES_COLLECTIONS='[{"address":"0x123","network":"mainnet"}]' # Optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_PROVIDER=wagmi # Optional: "wagmi" (default) or "dogeos"
```

You can generate your key and copy UUIDs in the API KEYS tab on the admin dashboard.

### Wallet Provider

The template supports two wallet connection providers, controlled by `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_PROVIDER`:

- **`wagmi`** (default) — Uses wagmi's `injected()` connector for browser extension wallets (MetaMask, etc.). Standard EVM wallet flow.
- **`dogeos`** — Uses `@dogeos/dogeos-sdk` for wallet connections with social login support (email, Google, X) and embedded wallets. Includes all features of wagmi mode plus social login.

To switch to dogeos, set in your `.env`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_PROVIDER=dogeos
```

Both modes use the same authentication flow (SIWE + next-auth) and the same on-chain operations (wagmi). The wallet provider only affects how users connect their wallet.

To verify each mode works:

```sh
# Default (wagmi) — browser extension wallets
pnpm template:dev

# Dogeos — social login + embedded wallets
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_PROVIDER=dogeos pnpm template:dev

# Invalid value — falls back to wagmi
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_PROVIDER=foo pnpm template:dev
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```sh
pnpm template:dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Setup Scripts

The repository includes two scripts to help manage loyalty rules:

#### 1. Add Basic Rule Sets for Your Website

This script sets up an initial loyalty program with predefined rules. You'll need to create your loyalty currency.

```sh
pnpm rules:create
```

#### 2. Clear All Existing Rules

This script removes all loyalty rules associated with your website. Use this if you want to start clean with the rules set.

```sh
pnpm rules:remove
```
